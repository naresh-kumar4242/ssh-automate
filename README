My first official project ::: To automate the ssh into a remote server using python
This is my first little project in Python :)
It automates the following steps:

    - SSH into it (Ubuntu VM) with normal user(in my case with user naresh)
      We will be doing passwordless login to ubuntu VM.We generated SSH keys on our client & uploaded rsa_public key
      on server.We will authenticate once with simple ssh.
    
    - Install following packages
    - sudo apt-get install tree
    - sudo apt-get install cowsay   
    - prints the output of cowsay command
    
    - Add a user mayank | Give it some password
    - login with user mayank
    - Make dir testdir & touch a file testfile in mayank's home
    - log-out mayank 
    - Finally, power-off the system

Mods ::
Now we can login to multiple servers & install packages to all of them
