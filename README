My first official project ::: To automate the ssh into multiple remote servers using python
This is my first little project in Python :)
It automates the following steps :::

    - SSH into Ubuntu VMs with normal user(in my case with user naresh)
#We will be doing passwordless login to ubuntu VM.We generated SSH keys on our client & uploaded rsa_public key on server.We will authenticate once with simple ssh.
    - We will be taking Servers file(Contains UserNames & IPs of servers) & Packages file as command line arguments.   
    - First We install elinks standalone.
    - The we install all the packages as given in the file (tree,oneko,cowsay,nano,cmatrix) 
    # Here we also check whether the packages are already installed or not
    
    - Add a user mayank | Give it some password
    - login with user mayank
    - Make dir testdir & touch a file testfile in mayank's home
    - log-out mayank 
    - Finally, power-off the system

Mods :: Now we can login to multiple servers & install packages to all of them individually.
